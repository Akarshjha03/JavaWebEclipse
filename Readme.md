# Project Description

### Project 1 - MAVEN Project

This project demonstrates the use of Maven for dependency management in a Java web application. Maven is a powerful build automation tool used primarily for Java projects. It simplifies the process of managing project dependencies, and building, and deploying applications.

#### Features:
- Maven project structure
- Dependency management
- Build and deployment configuration

### Project 2 - Cookie Management

This project focuses on the management of cookies within a Java web application. Cookies are small pieces of data stored on the client's browser to maintain stateful information across multiple requests.

#### Features:
- Setting cookies
- Retrieving cookies
- Deleting cookies

### Project 3 - Login Session Management

This project demonstrates how to manage user login sessions in a Java web application. Session management is crucial for maintaining user state and ensuring secure access to application resources.

#### Features:
- User authentication
- Session creation and management
- Session invalidation

### Project 4 - CRUD Operations on Servlet

This project showcases how to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Java servlets. CRUD operations are fundamental to most web applications as they allow for the management of application data.

#### Features:
- Create operation: Adding new records
- Read operation: Retrieving records
- Update operation: Modifying existing records
- Delete operation: Removing records

### Project 5 - Printing Statement on Servlet

This project demonstrates how to print statements on a web page using Java servlets. It covers the basics of writing output to the clientâ€™s browser from a servlet.

#### Features:
- Setting up a servlet
- Printing text on a web page
- Handling HTTP requests and responses

### Project 6 - Basic Data Retrieval App

This project demonstrates a basic data retrieval application built using JSP (JavaServer Pages). The application allows users to log in and retrieve data after successful authentication.

#### Features:
- User login authentication
- Data retrieval post-login
- JSP for dynamic web content
- Secure data handling

### Project 7 - User Details Management System

This project is designed to manage user details using JSP (JavaServer Pages) and JDBC (Java Database Connectivity). The system allows users to view, add, update, and delete their details.

#### Features:
- User registration and login
- JSP for dynamic web content
- JDBC for database interactions
- Handling of user data

### Project 8 - Basic CRUD Operations with Hibernate

This project demonstrates a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using Hibernate ORM (Object-Relational Mapping). The application allows users to perform CRUD operations on a database through a simple interface.

#### Features:

- **Create:** Add new entries to the database.
- **Read:** Retrieve and display data from the database.
- **Update:** Modify existing data entries.
- **Delete:** Remove data entries from the database.
- **Hibernate ORM:** Simplifies database interactions by mapping Java objects to database tables.
- **JSP:** Used for rendering dynamic web content.
- **MVC Architecture:** Organized code structure following Model-View-Controller design.

### Project 9 - Basic CRUD Operations with Spring
This project demonstrates a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using the Spring Framework. The application allows users to perform CRUD operations on a database through a simple web interface.

#### Features:
- **Create**: Add new entries to the database.
- **Read:** Retrieve and display data from the database.
- **Update:** Modify existing data entries.
- **Delete:** Remove data entries from the database.
- **Spring Framework:** Leverages the Spring ecosystem for dependency injection, data persistence, and web functionality.
- **Spring Data JPA:** Simplifies database interactions by abstracting the repository layer and handling CRUD operations.
- **Spring MVC:** Follows the Model-View-Controller design pattern to organize the code structure.
- **Thymeleaf/JSP:** Used for rendering dynamic web content on the front-end.
